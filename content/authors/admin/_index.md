Iâ€™m a MSc candidate at [OSI Lab](osi.kaist.ac.kr) in the [Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence (GSAI)](gsai.kaist.ac.kr) at KAIST. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Se-Young Yun](fbsqkd.github.io). I completed my BSc in Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science (double major) at KAIST, where I worked with 4 research groups. (See 'Experience' below)

My interests range over the whole field of ML/DL with emphasis on their theoretical aspects + related mathematical theories, and their various applications. My other interests include, but are not limited to, probabilistic(Bayesian) ML/DL, graphs, algorithmic fairness, "other" areas of mathematics.

I'm a violinist at the KAIST Orchestra, where my passion for classical music is freely expressed.
