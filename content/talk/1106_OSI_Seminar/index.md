summary: This talk continues from Part 1, focusing more on the implication of such heavy-tailed theories of SGD to generalization and its origin.
abstract: Part 1 was about introducing reasons of why heavy-tailed model should be used to describe the SGD dynamics. This talk(Part 2) gives a from-ground talk on necessary mathematical background, and most importantly, **where the heavy-tailedness comes from.** If time allows, we shall also look at how Hausdorff dimension of the path of SGD is directly related to the **generalization capability**. On the way, various papers (ICML2019, ICML2020, NIPS2020, arXiv) will be briefly introduced.
